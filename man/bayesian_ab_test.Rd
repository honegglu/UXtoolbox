\title{Bayesian A/B Test for UX Comparisons}
\usage{
bayesian_ab_test(successes, trials, n_samples = 10000, ci = 0.95)
}
\arguments{
\item{successes}{A vector with the number of successes in each group (A, B).}

\item{trials}{A vector with the total trials in each group (A, B).}

\item{n_samples}{The number of samples to draw from the posterior distribution (default is 10000).}

\item{ci}{The credible interval width (default is 0.95).}
}
\value{
A list containing the probability that condition A is better than condition B,
the posterior distributions, and credible intervals.
}
\description{
Performs a Bayesian A/B test to estimate the probability that one condition (A) is better than another (B).
Provides credible intervals and effect size estimation.
