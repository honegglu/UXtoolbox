\title{GOMS Model for UX Task Performance Prediction}
\usage{
goms_model(
  keystrokes,
  pointing_actions,
  mental_operations,
  system_response = 0
)
}
\arguments{
\item{keystrokes}{Number of keystrokes required for the task.}

\item{pointing_actions}{Number of pointing (mouse movement) actions required.}

\item{mental_operations}{Number of cognitive (thinking) operations involved.}

\item{system_response}{Time taken by the system to respond in seconds (default is 0).}
}
\value{
A list containing estimated execution time and a breakdown of the task components.
}
\description{
Estimates task execution time using the GOMS model, considering keystrokes, pointing actions, and cognitive operations.
Provides a breakdown of task elements and an estimated total execution time.
}
\examples{
goms_model(keystrokes = 5, pointing_actions = 3, mental_operations = 2, system_response = 1)
}
