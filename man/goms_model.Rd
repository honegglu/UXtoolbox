\arguments{
\item{keystrokes}{Number of keystrokes required for the task.}

\item{pointing_actions}{Number of pointing (mouse movement) actions required.}

\item{mental_operations}{Number of cognitive (thinking) operations involved.}

\item{system_response}{Time taken by the system to respond in seconds (default is 0).}
}
\value{
Estimated total task execution time in seconds.
}
\description{
Estimates task execution time using the GOMS model.
