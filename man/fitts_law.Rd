\title{Fitts' Law Model for UX Performance Prediction}
\usage{
fitts_law(distance, width, a = 0.2, b = 0.1, weighted = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{distance}{A numeric vector representing the distance to the target (in pixels or cm).}

\item{width}{A numeric vector representing the target width (in pixels or cm).}

\item{a}{The regression constant (default is 0.2).}

\item{b}{The regression coefficient (default is 0.1).}

\item{weighted}{If TRUE, applies a weighted index for more realistic interaction modeling (default is FALSE).}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of predicted movement times.
}
\description{
Computes movement time using Fitts' Law based on target distance and size, predicting user interaction efficiency.
Supports both standard and weighted models for enhanced UX evaluation.

\examples{
distance <- c(100, 200, 300)
width <- c(10, 20, 30)
fitts_law(distance, width)
fitts_law(distance, width, weighted = TRUE)
