\title{Bayesian t-Test for UX Comparisons}
\usage{
bayesian_ttest(group1, group2, n_samples = 10000, ci = 0.95)
}
\arguments{
\item{group1}{A numeric vector representing values from the first UX condition.}

\item{group2}{A numeric vector representing values from the second UX condition.}

\item{n_samples}{The number of samples to draw from the posterior distribution (default is 10000).}

\item{ci}{The credible interval width (default is 0.95).}
}
\value{
A list containing the probability that group1 has a greater mean, posterior distributions,
credible intervals, and Bayesian effect size estimation.
}
\description{
Performs a Bayesian t-test to estimate the probability that two UX conditions have different means.
Provides posterior distributions, credible intervals, and effect size estimation.
