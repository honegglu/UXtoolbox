\title{Hick’s Law Model for UX Decision Time Prediction}
\usage{
hicks_law(choices, a = 0.2, b = 0.1)
}
\arguments{
\item{choices}{A numeric vector representing the number of available choices.}

\item{a}{The regression constant (default is 0.2).}

\item{b}{The regression coefficient (default is 0.1).}
}
\value{
A list containing computed decision times and a visualization.
}
\description{
Computes decision time using Hick’s Law based on the number of choices.
Provides a visualization of decision time growth as choices increase.
}
\examples{
choices <- c(2, 4, 8, 16)
hicks_law(choices)
}
